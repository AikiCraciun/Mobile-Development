# Mobile Development Project

## Intructions how to run the program
### Important
_The Project Files were too big to upload them in one piece. I had to split them in two parts. 
The content of node_modules directory from part 2 need to be copied in directory node_modules in part 1 in order to be able to compile the code._ 
1. Once all the folders from the .zip files are merged as indicated in the Important section, the step no. 2 can be performed. 
1. From the __project__ directory, run the following command line instruction (starting an Ionic development server and open a browser tab)
```
ionic serve
```
