Mobile Development Project

-----------------------IMPORTANT---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Project Files were too big to upload them in one piece. I had to split them in two parts. 
The content of node_modules directory from part 2 need to be copied in directory node_modules in part 1 in order to be able to compile the code.

The following are few remarks about the project:
-this app represents an Ionic Framework application for Mobile devices.
-the app includes usage of 2 APIs which feeds in data in JSON format.
-one JSON response gives a random quote data (quote content, quote type, quote author).
-the other JSON response gives information about country name, country flag, soccer players for the chosen country.
-users can input country ID for which they need information. 
-users can input a maximum and minimum age of country players they need information about.
-the app has 2no. pages, one Home page and another Settings page (in this one, users can input country ID, max. age, min. age).
